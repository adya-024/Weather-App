This Java-based Weather API application fetches real-time weather data from a public REST API and displays it in a clean and structured format. It is designed to help users retrieve current weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for any specified city. This utility is perfect for learners and developers looking to explore Javaâ€™s capabilities in API integration and JSON parsing.

The Weather API application includes the following features:

City-Based Weather Search: Enter any city name to fetch its latest weather information.

Real-Time Data: Retrieves up-to-date weather statistics using a public weather API.

Structured Display: Displays temperature, humidity, pressure, weather description, and wind speed in a readable format.

Error Handling: Informs users about invalid city names or network issues gracefully.

JSON Parsing: Efficiently parses JSON response using built-in or third-party libraries (e.g., org.json or Gson).

Future Enhancements
We plan to enhance the Weather API application with:

Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.
5-Day Weather Forecast** support.
Geolocation-Based Search.
Data Logging to store and review previous searches.
Unit Conversion (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
